# How it's made

We use:

`Covalent API endpoints` to get all NFTs balance and metadata from a wallet address such us images, contracts name, NFTs images, and balances.

- `NFTStorage`for data storage on IPFS that generates a transaction hash used to create an NFT of a photo.

- `textile/eth-storage`: facilitated a fast way to store metadata for communities such: as names, locations, descriptions, images, wallet addresses, and more. It was perfect for the soccer community's problem case to save their needs on the textile storage.

- `NFTPort` smooths the path of minting and donating NFTs for communities. This is a win-win situation for our comunities because they don't have to pay to contribute or mint NFTs.

- `Pocket Portal` smooths the path of deploying and the hustle of paying such big transactions to deploy our communities' contract to a node using the Rinkeby network.

- `Skynet` facilitated the process of deploying our dApp front-end application in a seamless way.

- `Solidity` for the smart contract.

- `OpenZeppelin ERC721` we use the ERC721 template for faster development of the PetGram smart contract.

- `Ganache` for local blockchain development.

- `Rinkeby Network` is the network where we deployed our dApp.

- `React Js, Material-ui, Web3` React Js for the frontend, Material-ui and Web3 to connect to the blockchain.
